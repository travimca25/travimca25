Kernal is heart of any operating system - mainly responsible to let communicate with hardware with the software
terminal - to open terminal(ctrl+alt+t) its like cmd in windows
vijay@localhost:~$ - $ specifies regular user, # specifies root user
pwd - print working directory
cd ~(tilt) : move to home directory
cd / : move to root directory
cd /tmp/vijay/ : move to vijay directory under tmp folder
cd .. : move to tmp directory
ls - list all files in the current directory
ls -al : Display all files
cat > test : creates and allows to add connect file,ctr+D is come out
cat test test2 > test3 : merge test,test2 and put content in test3
rm fileName : removes the file
mv filename newfileName
rmdir : removes the directory, even removes files under this directory
sudo mv filename newfileName : sudo is super user, retains 15 min for that terminal session
mkdir directoryname
man ls : helps regarding information about ls
history : displays all the history details
clear : clear the command
There are three types of user : user(owner of the file), user group, other users
Read-write-Execute : for a particular file
r - read permission, w - write permission, x - execute permission - - no permission
drwxr-x--- : d specifies directory if it is (-) then its not directory,rwx - then user can perform all steps,then r-x - onlyread and execute,--- can do any operation - other users
chmod : we can change - two ways - absolute mode and symbolic mode
absolute mode 0 - no permission - ---
1 - execute - --x

2 - write - -w-

3 - execute+write - -wx

4 - read - r--

5 - read+execute - r-x

6 - read+write - rw-

7 - read+write+execute - rwx

chmod 764 test - rwxrw-r-- permission will set

symbolic mode : + add permission, - remove permission, = sets permission and override the permission set earlier

chmod o=rwx test : other set rwx permission, g+x - group has execute permision, u-r - user removed read permission

chown root filename : changes the owner to root

chgrp root filename : changes the group to root
